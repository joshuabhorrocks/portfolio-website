# My Portfolio Website

Joshua Horrock's portfolio website, made by Joshua Horrocks. I built this website to highlight my skills as a web developer. It features a Home page for general information, a Project page for a small list of projects I've completed, and a Contact page with links to social platforms I can be contacted through.

## How was it made?

This site was developed using JavaScript and Creat-React-App. It's hosted on Vercel using a custom domain.
